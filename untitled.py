\textbf{Biological Plausibility Issues with Backpropagation:} Despite its widespread application, error backpropagation has been frequently criticized for its lack of biological realism in synaptic credit assignment. This includes its inconsistency with neural circuitry knowledge and the violation of the localized nature of synaptic plasticity~\citep{grossberg1987competitive, crick1989recent}. Key issues such as the weight transport problem, non-local credit assignment, and update locking problem challenge its biological plausibility and effectiveness~\citep{burbank2012depression, whittington2019theories, jaderberg2017decoupled}.

\textbf{Inspiration from Biological Systems:} In contrast to these limitations, biological systems exhibit highly efficient mechanisms such as the counter-current exchange observed in fish gills and mammalian kidneys. These systems optimize resource transfer and signal processing through anti-parallel flows, which maintain optimal gradients and efficiency. This natural mechanism of exchange and processing inspires a novel approach to neural network design, aiming to replicate the efficiency and locality of biological systems.

\textbf{Counter-Current Learning With a Dual Network Structure:} Motivated by the efficiency of biological systems, we propose a dual network architecture for neural learning, termed counter-current learning. This structure involves a feedforward network for processing input data and a feedback network for handling targets, with each network enhancing the otherâ€™s learning process through anti-parallel signal propagation. This design directly addresses the non-locality and update locking problems of traditional backpropagation by allowing local and real-time adjustments.

\textbf{Benefits of the Dual Network Approach:} The counter-current learning model offers multiple advantages. It bypasses the weight transport problem by eliminating the need for identical weight sets in forward and feedback paths. It also supports local learning, akin to Hebbian principles, and ensures that learning can occur in real time, thus resolving the update locking issue. These enhancements make our approach not only more biologically plausible but also potentially more effective in complex learning scenarios.
